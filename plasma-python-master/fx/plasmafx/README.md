# PlasmaFX - LED effects sequencing

PlasmaFX allows you to split a chain of Plasma LEDs into chunks, each handled by its own plugin.

For example, you can assign a plugin to a Plasma Light board so it can control the 4 onboard LEDs in interesting ways.

Or, you could assign a plugin to an Adafruit NeoPixel ring wired in series with other NeoPixel boards.
