Plasma LEDs Colour Cycle Patterns
---------------------------------

These 24-bit PNGs are animated across Plasma's LEDs to produce dynamic lighting effects.

To create your own you must create a 24-bit PNG file.

The width of that PNG file should be:

* 1 pixel - will be duplicated to every LED
* 4 pixels - will be duplicated to every button
* 36 pixels - individual LED values for 6 buttons
* 40 pixels - individual LED values for 10 buttons

The height of the PNG file in pixels corresponds to the number of frames in the animation.

Since Plasma is animated at 60fps, a 60 pixel high animation will last for 1 second.
